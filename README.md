# ReverseRecruiting
Hudl has tools that help recruiters find potential players, but there are no tools for an athlete to search for possible college programs. ReverseRecruiting is an intern skunkworks project that gives high school soccer players the ability to filter through programs using an interactive map that compares college's academic and soccer programs. Althetes can filter by state, conference, college acceptance rate, win percentage, tuition, and population. The page also populates with instagram photos tagged with that specific soccer program.
